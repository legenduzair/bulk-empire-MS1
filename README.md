# Bulk Empire
## Introduction
Bulk Empire is an online weightlifting club that offers many services such as workout advice, routines, tutorials and online personal training sessions to assist people who are motivated and interested to begin lifting weights or exercising to improve their lifestyle. Due to the nature of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the site is targetted at an audience who prefer to exercise remotely at home with the gym equipment provided to reduce the risk of being infected and to feel safer.

## UX
## Wireframes
Before developing the website, I used Balsamiq Wireframes to design the potential layout and structure of content for each page for desktop, tablet and mobile view. The wireframes designed are listed below.

## Features

### Regular Features
- Navigation Bar

  - The navigation bar is located at the top of the website across all pages and has an identical design for easy navigation.
  - Across the entire website, the company logo is placed on the right and the navigation links are placed on the left. These links include Home, Workouts, Memberships and Sign Up. All of these titles link to their corresponding pages for easy navigation. The company logo acts as a shortcut back to the home page.
  - The navigation bar is designed to be fully responsive across all smaller viewport sizes. For mobile/smaller sized screens, the format of the bar is adjusted to a column display where the navigation links are aligned vertically below the company logo which is centered at the top of the page. For tablets/medium sized screens, the links are horizontally aligned and are placed below the company logo which is centered at the top of the page.
  - The company logo and navigation links can be hovered over to display an orange color using the rgba color model. This specific color is used for various content on the website.

- Footer

  - The footer section is located at the bottom of each web page and supplies useful contact information. It includes the relevant social media links in the format of their respective logos,that Bulk Empire is present on. 
  - These links are helpful to keep the user engaged in learning and reading more information about Bulk Empire and is also beneficial to the company by increasing social media following and recognition globally.
  - The background color of the footer is a darker variant of grey that offers visual contrast to the background color of the main section which is a lighter grey. Like the links in the header, the footer links can also be hovered over to display the same orange color.

### Hidden Pages

  - One page that does not appear on navigation bar is the sign up confirmation page that users can access once they have entered the giveaway by completing the form.
  - A thank you for participating message is displayed on the screen. This indicates confirmation to the user that they have successfully entered the giveaway, whilst also providing information on future contests and the quality of rewards the user can potentially acquire.
  - A background image of a client and a trainee exercising together is present to display to the user the morals and goals of Bulk Empire. This is a common design element used across the website.

## Future Improvements
- Media Elements
  - The current version of the website includes limited media elements such as images. It would be ideal to have more media content such as workout tutorials in the format of videos or audio players. 

- Workout Challenges and Classes Schedule
  - It would be motivating and beneficial to users wanting to join Bulk Empire to include a workout challenges and classes schedule. This could provide information on the diversity of workout classes taught by personal trainers and challenges existing Bulk Empire members have engaged in for successful personal achievements and goals. 

## Testing 
After developing the initial layout of the website for desktop/larger screens, the website went through rigorous testing utilising Google Chrome's developer tools to create a fully responsive website for different screen sizes. The site was continuously tested by applying styling and checking the application of the changes made using a live server window. Every page was organised and structured carefully from header to footer for a variety of displays:

- Desktop Computer: 1920 x 1080p
- HP EliteBook 840 G4: 1366 x 768p
- IPad Pro: 1024 x 1366p
- IPhone 5/SE: 320 x 568p

The website was also tested on devices using other browsers:

- IPhone 11 Pro Max: 414 x 896p
  - iOS Safari
- Desktop Computer: 1920 x 1080p
  - Microsoft Edge
- IPad Air: 820 x 1180p
  - Mozilla Firefox
- Laptop: 1280 x 800p
  - Mozilla Firefox

### Bugs 
- Fixed Bugs
  - When creating the sign up button on the home page, there was a small issue with its interactivity. This was due to the button not being in its own parent element. To fix this, I placed the button inside a parent div element to position it below the company background text. 
  - After I was designing my first wireframes on Balsamiq, it was uploaded onto GitHub. However, the wireframes were not displaying properly so I had to rename the wireframes and uploaded my second wireframes file.
    - [First Wireframes File](https://github.com/legenduzair/bulk-empire-MS1/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/bulkempire-wireframes.pdf) 
    - [Second Wireframes File](https://github.com/legenduzair/bulk-empire-MS1/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/bulkempire-wireframes-1.pdf)
  - When designing my website to be fully responsive, I had positioned most of my content using absolute positioning which caused many issues of elements overlapping when reducing the screen size. To resolve this, I learned how to utilise flexbox CSS layout to position my content the way I preferred.
