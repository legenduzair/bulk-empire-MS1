# Bulk Empire
## Introduction
Bulk Empire is an online weightlifting club that offers many services such as workout advice, routines, tutorials and online personal training sessions to assist people who are motivated and interested to begin lifting weights or exercising to improve their lifestyle. Due to the nature of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the site is targetted at an audience who prefer to exercise remotely at home with the gym equipment provided to reduce the risk of being infected and to feel safer.

## Features

### Regular Features
- Navigation Bar

  - The navigation bar is located at the top of the website across all pages and has an identical design for easy navigation.
  - Across the entire website, the company logo is placed on the right and the navigation links are placed on the left. These links include Home, Workouts, Memberships and Sign Up. All of these titles link to their corresponding pages for easy navigation. The company logo acts as a shortcut back to the home page.
  - The navigation bar is designed to be fully responsive across all smaller viewport sizes. For mobile/smaller sized screens, the format of the bar is adjusted to a column display where the navigation links are aligned vertically below the company logo which is centered at the top of the page. For tablets/medium sized screens, the links are horizontally aligned and are placed below the company logo which is centered at the top of the page.
  - The company logo and navigation links can be hovered over to display an orange color using the rgba color model. This specific color is used for various content on the website.

  - The background color of the footer is a darker variant of grey that offers visual contrast to the background color of the main section which is a lighter grey. Like the links in the header, the footer links can also be hovered over to display the same orange color.
