# Bulk Empire
## Introduction
Bulk Empire is an online weightlifting club that offers many services such as workout advice, routines, tutorials and online personal training sessions to assist people who are motivated and interested to begin lifting weights or exercising to improve their lifestyle. Due to the nature of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the site is targetted at an audience who prefer to exercise remotely at home with the gym equipment provided to reduce the risk of being infected and to feel safer.

## UX
## Wireframes
Before developing the website, I used Balsamiq Wireframes to design the potential layout and structure of content for each html page for desktop, tablet and mobile view. The wireframes designed are listed below.
